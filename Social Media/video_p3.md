# Mnemosyne Video — Part 3 of 5: Storing in the Knowledge Graph

**Story Beat:** Mnemosyne places the idea into her knowledge graph. It connects and integrates.

## Prompt

```
Continuing scene. The ethereal figure holds the bright golden orb between her hands in the dark cinematic space.

She raises the orb and releases it with a gentle upward push. It floats into the constellation-like knowledge graph orbiting her, slowing and settling into position among other glowing nodes.

As it locks into place, luminous blue edges (#388BFD) shoot outward connecting to 3-4 nearby nodes with pulses of blue-white light. Each connected node brightens briefly in recognition. A ripple of golden light propagates through the entire network — node to node — showing knowledge integrating.

The orb transitions from bright gold to steady warm amber (#D4A574), matching the others — it belongs now. She lowers her hands with calm satisfaction. The graph settles into a gentle breathing pulse.

Medium-wide shot, pulling back slightly to reveal the graph's scale. Semi-abstract digital art, dark-tech cinematic, elegant and precise. NOT photorealistic. 16:9, 6-7s, 24fps. No realistic face, no text overlays.
