# Mnemosyne Video — Part 4 of 5: Retrieving the Memory

**Story Beat:** A query arrives. Mnemosyne searches the graph, finds the idea, and plucks it out.

## Prompt

```
Time has passed — the knowledge graph is denser with more nodes, pulsing gently. The ethereal figure stands calmly at center, data streams flowing relaxed.

A thin blue line (#4A9EFF) pulses from the right — a query from a user (soft silhouette at far right edge). The pulse reaches Mnemosyne; her data streams accelerate.

She raises one hand toward the graph. A search wave — a ring of soft blue light — expands from her fingertips through the graph. Nodes flash and dim as the wave scans them. It reaches the stored node, which flares bright gold (#F0C75E).

She reaches toward the highlighted node with graceful precision. Her fingers close around it and draw it out — connections stretch like luminous elastic threads, then detach with tiny sparks. The orb brightens in her hand, data fragments orbiting it again, knowledge reactivated.

She begins turning toward the right — toward the requesting user.

Medium shot, slow pan right following her turn. Semi-abstract digital art, dark-tech cinematic. Search wave feels precise and intelligent. NOT photorealistic. 16:9, 6-7s, 24fps. No realistic face, no text overlays.
