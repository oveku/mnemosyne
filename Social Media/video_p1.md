# Mnemosyne Video — Part 1 of 5: The Idea Arrives

**Story Beat:** An agent sends a glowing idea toward Mnemosyne. She turns to receive it.

## Prompt

```
Dark cinematic space blending Greek temple columns with server room geometry. Deep navy background (#0D1117). Ambient particles drift lazily.

Left edge: a small abstract agent silhouette pulses blue (#4A9EFF). A bright golden orb detaches and travels along a thin luminous line toward center frame, trailing amber particles (#D4A574).

Center: an ethereal semi-transparent feminine figure made of flowing golden data streams and glowing graph nodes stands motionless, facing slightly away. As the orb approaches she slowly turns her head, her form brightens, data streams accelerate. She extends one hand toward the incoming orb.

The orb is still in transit at clip end — building anticipation.

Static wide shot, very slow push-in mid-clip. Warm amber side-light left, cool blue backlight right. Semi-abstract digital art, dark-tech cinematic, calm motion. NOT photorealistic. 16:9, 5-6s, 24fps. No realistic face, no text overlays.
