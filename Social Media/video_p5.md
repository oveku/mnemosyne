# Mnemosyne Video — Part 5 of 5: Presenting to the User

**Story Beat:** Mnemosyne faces the viewer and presents the retrieved idea — "I kept this for you."

## Prompt

```
The ethereal feminine figure now faces the camera directly. The knowledge graph constellation orbits gently behind her.

She holds the bright golden orb (#F0C75E) at her side, then slowly extends both hands forward toward the camera — presenting it as an offering. The orb lifts from her palm, hovering between her hands and the camera.

The orb expands subtly and blooms — data fragments unfurl like petals of light, revealing structured knowledge: faint symbols and connection patterns that dissolve beautifully. Warm golden light washes forward toward the camera through volumetric haze.

Behind her, the entire knowledge graph responds — nodes brightening in a wave from center outward. Her posture is open, welcoming — an ancient keeper of memory inviting the viewer closer.

Final frame holds: the orb glowing between her and the viewer, an intimate offering. Slight lens flare adds cinematic warmth.

Medium close-up, very slow push-in toward the orb. Shallow depth of field. Semi-abstract digital art, dark-tech cinematic, warm and generous. NOT photorealistic. 16:9, 6-7s, 24fps. No realistic face, no text overlays, no abrupt ending.
