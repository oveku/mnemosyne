# Mnemosyne Video — Part 2 of 5: She Catches the Idea

**Story Beat:** Mnemosyne receives the glowing idea and examines it in her hands.

## Prompt

```
Continuing scene. The ethereal feminine figure — flowing amber/gold data streams and glowing graph nodes — stands at center in a dark cinematic space with faint Greek columns.

A bright golden orb arrives at her extended hand along a thin blue line from the left. On contact, a warm pulse of amber light (#F0C75E) radiates from her palm. She draws the orb close, cradling it with both hands.

The orb rotates slowly between her palms, casting golden light upward. Tiny glowing data fragments and JSON-like wisps orbit the orb — structured knowledge revealed. Her data streams flow faster as she connects with the information. She tilts her head, appreciating what the idea contains.

Medium shot, centered. Very slow orbit ~10 degrees clockwise. Warm amber light from below (the orb). Semi-abstract digital art, dark-tech cinematic, calm and reverent. NOT photorealistic. 16:9, 5-6s, 24fps. No realistic face, no text overlays.
